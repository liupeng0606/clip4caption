# Reproducing CLIP4Caption
This is unofficial implementation of CLIP4Caption method.

**Note**: the extracted features are not extracted using TSN sampling as in the CLIP4Caption paper. It is found that even without TSN sampling, i.e., only using original sampling method in CLIP4Clip, the similar performance results can be achieved as in the CLIP4Caption paper. Using VTM is actually hurt the performance.
